This is the source to the uuid library. Most of it is blatently ripped off from
the included RFC's, all licences are in the right place (I hope).

uuidlib.[ch] is the interface for the Interbase UDF stuff. There's an SQL file,
it will make the UDF stubs in the database.

The source here loads into anjuta (anjuta.sf.net), or can be built from the
command line with 'make uuidlib'

If you have a cross compiler installed you can build the windows version under
linux too, type 'make uuidlib.dll'. The crosscompiler needs to be buit for
i586-pc-mingw32.

To build it under windows you'll need the MinGW tools installed, and a quick
edit of the makefile to cope with the c:\ stuff and the include and library
paths. Make sure you -D_WINDOWS_, or you'll get errors.
